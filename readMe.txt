In this readMe file, I talk about the assignment.

a GUI program to anticipate and compensate for user errors,
but it’s even better if the program is designed to catch errors as soon as the user makes them and
guide the user toward correcting them. Remember the three pillars of good error messages:
• identify where the error occurred — direct the user to the precise location of the error
• identify why the error occurred — explain exactly what the problem is
• suggest how to correct the error — provide information to guide the user to correcting
his/her entry

Modify page to validate all data entered by the user using the jQuery Validation
plugin (http://plugins.jquery.com) or found here (https://jqueryvalidation.org/) and
prevent the form from being submitted (or the table from being regenerated) if the user’s
entry contains an error. If there is no error, regenerate the table as in the previous
assignment.
Explore the various jQuery Validation plugin options carefully. Read the text, study
examples below, and search for additional examples online. Customize the error
messages displayed by the plugin so that they make sense in the context of your
application. Customize where the error messages are placed to maintain complete control
over how your page looks.
